        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>It's about time that I have a website, so here it is! I'm going to start super simple with some basic html/css, but will eventually step things up with and use React and SCSS. Looking forward to seeing the progress of this site over the next 100 days as I partake in the<a href="http://www.100daysofcode.com/">#100daysofcode</a> challenge. If you want to follow my progress, be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/_jennifertsui">follow me on Twitter</a>!</p>
